            <p>
                At the University of Michigan, we are committed to ensuring that all students have access to fundamental resources that support their well-being and academic success. Our Basic Needs Center is dedicated to assisting students in navigating the challenges related to essential needs like food, housing, healthcare, and financial security.

            <p>
                Basic needs encompass the essential resources required to thrive, including access to nutritious food, stable housing, healthcare, personal care items, and financial stability. Addressing these needs is crucial for fostering a supportive and inclusive educational environment.
